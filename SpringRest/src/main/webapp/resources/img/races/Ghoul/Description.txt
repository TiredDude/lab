From the first look they are normal people, but it becomes hard to control ghoul inside when they are ungry or feel taste or smell of blood.
When hunger prevails ghoul reveals his natural form - black eyes with red pupils, hair can fall off or change it colour and in some cases muscles increase their size or change in form.

Angry ghouls are very dangerous, they physical abilities become much stronger, they feel less pain falling into some sort of rage when all what they want is to fill their stomach with fresh humans flesh, also ghouls heart beating is highly increased that makes their reactions faster and even heal wounds much better.
Being a ghoul means that you cannot eat nothing else except human flesh, almost all other food taste like shit for them, however for common ghoul one good dinner will be enough to feel no hunger for a week.

Ghouls have very different personalities, some are lonely misfits who lives with no purpose and feel no sorry for killing people to survive, others are more peacefully and even sociable - they usually create secret groups inside big towns and do not kill innocent, consuming only already dead people but there are also those who finds pleasure in murder and does not restrained their appetites...
